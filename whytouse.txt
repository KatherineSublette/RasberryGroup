The updated factorial function uses two repositories while the default uses 4.
Our code also does not store anything on the stack until linking the value in r0. 
This makes it more compact from a memeory perspective as the default requires storing several calculations on the stack.
Finally, because our program has to waste no time shifting values and pointers to and from the stack it manages to preform the task in far fewer cycles.
